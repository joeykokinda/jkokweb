            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              Exoform is my personal e-commerce platform for selling 3D printed items. The shop focuses on quality prints with a clean, straightforward approach—no fluff, just well-designed products that I print and ship myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The goal was to build an online storefront that lets the products speak for themselves, with a focus on fast performance, clean design, and a smooth checkout experience.

                <strong>Rotating Image Carousel:</strong> 360-degree product views allowing customers to see items from every angle. This was one of the more complex features to implement, requiring optimization for smooth rotation and fast loading

            <h2>Custom Backend Logic</h2>
            <p>
              Rather than using a traditional CMS, the shop runs on custom Next.js API routes that handle:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Product catalog management</li>
              <li>Stripe payment intent creation</li>
              <li>Order processing and tracking</li>
              <li>Webhook handling for payment confirmation</li>
              <li>Real-time inventory updates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This approach provides full control over the shopping experience while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable.
            </p>

          <section className="project-section">
            <h2>Design Approach</h2>
            <p>
              The design philosophy is simple: clean, functional, and focused on the products. The interface stays out of the way, letting customers browse and purchase without unnecessary distractions. High-quality product photography combined with the 360-degree carousel gives customers confidence in what they're buying.

          <section className="project-section">
            <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              The rotating image carousel was the most technically demanding feature. It required careful optimization to ensure smooth transitions and fast loading times, especially for high-resolution product images. The solution involved preloading images, optimizing file sizes, and implementing efficient rendering logic.
