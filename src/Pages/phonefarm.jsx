              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                PhoneFarm is a local web dashboard for monitoring and controlling
                a fleet of Android phones from one Linux machine over wireless
                ADB. Each phone shows up as a live, interactive tile in a
                responsive grid — you click and type directly into any screen
                with your mouse and keyboard. I run 6+ devices at once over wifi
                from a laptop.
              </p>
              <p>
                It streams each phone's screen with the scrcpy server (H.264 over
                a socket) and decodes it in the browser with WebCodecs, so it
                stays light enough to drive many phones in real time.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section className="project-section">
              <h2>Features</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Live control:</strong> one tile per phone; taps,
                  swipes, scroll, and full keyboard forwarded to the focused
                  device, plus per-tile Back / Home / Recents / Wake / Sleep /
                  Reconnect.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Control all:</strong> mirror every input to the whole
                  fleet at once. Coordinates are normalized, so each phone
                  applies the gesture at the same relative spot regardless of
                  resolution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Macros:</strong> record or hand-build ordered input
                  sequences and replay them across every phone in near-lockstep
                  — once, looped, or on a schedule. Schedules run server-side and
                  persist across restarts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Self-healing:</strong> a watchdog auto-reconnects
                  stalled or dropped tiles with exponential backoff.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>How It Works</h2>
              <p>
                On startup a Node server runs <code>adb connect</code> for every
                device in the config, pushes and starts the scrcpy server on each
                one, and reads the H.264 video stream plus a control channel. The
                browser opens one WebSocket per tile, decodes the video with
                WebCodecs to a canvas, and sends clicks and keystrokes back as
                scrcpy control messages. Failed phones surface as red tiles with
                the error; working ones go green and start streaming.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section className="project-section">
              <h2>Remote Access</h2>
              <p>
                ADB has no auth or encryption, so the phones and their ADB ports
                stay on the LAN only. The dashboard runs on an always-on Linux box
                on the phones' wifi and is reached over Tailscale (WireGuard) —
                nothing is exposed to the public internet. Since WebCodecs needs a
                secure context, TLS is terminated over the tailnet so the decoder
                works from anywhere.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section className="project-section">
              <h2>Stack</h2>
              <p>
                Node.js server (HTTP + WebSocket, REST API), scrcpy server for
                capture and control, WebCodecs for in-browser H.264 decode, and
                Android platform-tools / ADB. Optional scrypt-hashed login,
                Tailscale for private remote access. Roughly 88% JavaScript with a
                small HTML/CSS front end.
