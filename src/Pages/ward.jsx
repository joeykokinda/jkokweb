              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                WARD is rails for an autonomous system to hire and pay a verified human for physically-verifiable work, settled on-chain. The instrumented home is the first instance, not the product: a home agent watches your devices, fixes what it can in software, and when the fault is physical it hires a verified worker and pays them in USDC the moment a sensor attests the repair. Nobody clicks approve — the sensor does.
              </p>
              <p>
                It runs end to end on Arc testnet: worker identity and discovery on ENS, escrow and settlement on Arc, and the fix attested by a Chainlink CRE workflow. It's a working implementation of <strong>ERC-8183</strong>, Ethereum's Agentic Commerce standard.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <a href="https://web-nine-ashen-75.vercel.app/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="inline-link">/live</a> console runs the real agent, not a script — trigger a fault (or describe one in plain English) and it settles on Arc in about ten seconds, replaying its reasoning one line at a time with every transaction clickable.
              </p>

              <h2>The Problem</h2>
              <p>
                The real customer isn't the homeowner — it's software with no bank account: DePIN fleets paying the humans who keep their hardware alive, DAOs posting proof-gated repair jobs, AI-agent treasuries settling with field techs on attested evidence. For one homeowner paying a local plumber, credit cards and ACH work fine. Crypto is load-bearing only when the buyer is software that cannot open a bank account. WARD is the reference implementation of ERC-8183 those buyers need, and the 2am leak — owner asleep in Tokyo, sensor tripped in Brooklyn — is the most legible way to show it working.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section className="project-section">
              <h2>How It Works</h2>
              <p>
                WARD doesn't jump to hiring a human. It climbs an escalation ladder cheapest-first. <strong>L1 self-fix</strong> is free, instant, and autonomous — reboot, reconfigure, re-pair, cycle a relay, close a smart valve — and most incidents end here. <strong>L2 guided remote</strong> is an optional scripted remediation, still no human. <strong>L3 hire a human</strong> is the last resort, used only when the fault is physical and software can't resolve it: it spends money and dispatches a person, so it runs only within the owner's spending policy. A WiFi fault gets fixed at L1 by a remote reboot; the 2am leak fails L1 because the burst is upstream of the valve, so it escalates to L3 and hires a plumber.
              </p>
              <p>
                ERC-8183 defines a <em>Job</em>: an escrowed budget, three roles, one state machine — and it says the Evaluator alone releases escrow, but never says the Evaluator has to be human. WARD makes the Evaluator a sensor. The autonomous home agent is the <strong>Client</strong> (requests the repair, funds the escrow), the field tech is the <strong>Provider</strong> (shows up, calls <code>submit</code>), and a Chainlink CRE workflow is the <strong>Evaluator</strong> — it reads device telemetry, attests the fix, and is the only role that calls <code>complete()</code>, releasing USDC and bumping the worker's reputation. The whole Job lifecycle is single-chain on Arc: no bridge, no second EVM.
              </p>
              <p>
                Worker identity and discovery run on real ENS, not a label on top of a database. <code>ward-agent.eth</code> carries an ENSIP-25 agent-registration record; each field tech is a subname with ENSIP-26 text records (skills, region, and a CAIP-10 pointer to on-chain reputation). The agent resolves them live to discover and rank candidates — nothing is hardcoded. USDC is also the gas token on Arc, so settlement is gas-free and sub-cent. Both contracts are source-verified and 56 forge tests pass.
              </p>
