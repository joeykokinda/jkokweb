            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              StakLabs is a student-run web development and digital services company operating out of Downingtown STEM Academy. Working alongside my brother and fellow students, we built a legitimate business that serves real clients with professional-grade web development, mobile apps, and digital marketing services.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes StakLabs unique is its sustainability model: when the founding class graduates, they pass the company to the next generation of STEM students. Those students continue the legacy, passing it forward again. StakLabs remains student-run and community-focused indefinitely.
